## 🚧 Challenges I Faced

> Every struggle was a step forward. Here's what challenged me the most:

- 🔄 Getting full background image visibility while keeping the text properly aligned
- 🎯 Matching Apple’s button styling: spacing, color, font weight, and hover feel
- 💬 Creating Apple-style message bubbles with curved tails:
  - CSS-only solutions were difficult and inflexible
  - Solved by using inline SVG for smoother and scalable tail design
- 😓 Making emojis appear inside the bubble without layout issues
- 🧊 Blurring Apple’s fixed/sticky header — learned to use `backdrop-filter`
